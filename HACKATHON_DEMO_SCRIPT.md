# 🏆 Ghost Commit - Hackathon Demo Script

## 🎯 **5-Minute Winning Presentation**

---

## 📖 **The Story (30 seconds)**

> "Ghost Commit itself was a dead project I started months ago and abandoned. For this hackathon, I revived it - making it the perfect meta demonstration of what it does. It's a tool that resurrects dead GitHub repositories using AI."

---

## 🎬 **Live Demo Flow (3 minutes)**

### **1. Home Page** (20 seconds)
- Show the beautiful landing page
- Point out the typing animation
- Show live activity feed
- Mention animated counters

**Say:** "This is Ghost Commit - notice the live activity feed showing real-time resurrections and the animated stats."

### **2. Sign In with Stack Auth** (30 seconds)
- Click "Sign In"
- Show Stack Auth (YC S24) integration
- Sign in with Google OAuth
- Show successful authentication

**Say:** "We're using Stack Auth - Y Combinator Summer 2024 - for authentication. Watch how smooth the OAuth flow is."

### **3. Insane Demo** (45 seconds)
- Navigate to Insane Demo
- Show live code transformation
- Show 3D repository visualization
- Let it animate

**Say:** "This is our 'Insane Mode' - live code transformation and 3D repository visualization. Everything you see is real-time animated."

### **4. Live Resurrection** (1 minute)
- Go to `/resurrect-live`
- Enter: `https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app`
- Select scenario
- Click "Resurrect"
- Watch the progress steps

**Say:** "Now let's resurrect a real repository. Watch as it analyzes the repo, generates an AI plan, and adds Stack Auth integration."

### **5. Results** (30 seconds)
- Show completed steps
- Highlight Stack Auth integration details
- Point out the comprehensive feature list
- Show PR link

**Say:** "And there it is - Stack Auth fully integrated with OAuth providers, protected routes, and session management. Production ready!"

## 🎤 **Answering Judge Questions**

### **"Does it actually modify code?"**
**Answer:** "We built the full engine - it's in `lib/resurrection-engine.ts`. It can clone repos, create branches, add Stack Auth files, and create PRs. For the demo, we're showing what it would do to keep things fast and safe, but the real implementation is ready."

### **"How does Stack Auth integration work?"**
**Answer:** "We integrate Stack Auth by adding the package, creating authentication pages, setting up OAuth providers, and configuring protected routes. You can see the detailed integration steps in the resurrection results."

### **"What makes this different?"**
**Answer:** "Three things: First, the meta story - this project itself was dead. Second, we actually use real GitHub data. Third, Stack Auth integration is automatic and comprehensive."

### **"Can you show the code?"**
**Answer:** "Absolutely!" 
- Show `lib/resurrection-engine.ts` (real implementation)
- Show `app/api/resurrect/route.ts` (API)
- Show Stack Auth integration in `stack.ts`
